# Hearthstone Card App

This app is currently in development, but once the MVP is complete, you'll be able to search HearthstoneÂ® cards and filter by class, type, set, and rarity.

## Run App in Local Environment

### Initial Setup

Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Build

This should be run initially, and then anytime the client-side JavaScript (`public/js/app.js`) is updated. It will create `bundle.js` in the `public/js` folder. It is needed to make the npm package `slim-select` available to client-side code.

```
npm run build
```

### Run App

Run app in dev mode (uses [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) to restart server when files change. Press `Ctrl-C` to stop server):

```
npm run dev
```

Run app:

```
npm run start
```

## Update Card Data and Card Sets

### Update Card Data

After a new card expansion comes out (or any time you know of an update being made to cards) run `npm run getCards` to save card data from the HearthstoneJSON API to `data/cards.json`.

### Update Card Set Names

After a new expansion comes out, first follow instructions in "Update Card Data" above. 
Then, run `npm run updateSets` to find out the set code for the new expansion.
If any new card sets have been added to cards in `data/cards.json` that aren't yet in `data/card-sets.json`, a message will be logged to the console with set codes for sets that need to be manually added to `data/card-sets.json`. To manually add a set, you'll need to first find the full set name that goes with the set code and then add an item to the array:

Example:
```
{"type": "DALARAN",
 "name": "Rise of Shadows",
 "format": "standard"}
  ```

Once any sets have been manually added, delete `data/card-sets-to-manually-add.json` so a message won't be logged about it when starting up the app.

### Update Mechanics

Also, each new expansion often adds new mechanics. To add any new mechanics to the "Mechanics" filter, add the new mechanic to the array in `data/mechanics-list.json`.

Example:
```
  {"type": "TWINSPELL",
   "name": "Twinspell"}
```
Note that `"type"` is what the API calls the mechanic, and name is the name to display in the filter. Sometimes, unfortunately the name the API gives it isn't the correct name, for instance it calls the Magnetic mechanic "Modular". 

You can get a list of mechanics by running `npm run updateMechanics` which will put all unique mechanics from cards in `data/cards.json` in `mechanics-list-raw.json` and you could look through that file to figure it out. Note that I don't use all the mechanics in that file in the filter (See comment at the top of `mechanics-list-raw.json` for more info.)

### Update Tribes

When and if a new tribe (ie. dragon, murloc, mech, etc) is added to cards, run `npm run updateTribes` to update the tribes that you can filter by.

## Browser Compatibility

IE is not currently supported.

Known issues with IE:

* Inputs on the sidebar do not work. The `form` attribute is used to associate inputs outside of the search form with the form. To add support for IE, either research and find an HTML 5 polyfill that supports the form attribute, or refactor to use hidden inputs in the search form that get updated with data from the sidebar inputs when the form is submitted. 

## Technologies Used

* JavaScript
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [HearthstoneJSON API](https://hearthstonejson.com/)

## TODO

**MVP:**  
* Implement functionality in `get-card-json.js` to retrieve data from the HearthstoneJSON API and save it to a file.
* Implement Searching cards on the website.
* Implement search result filtering for different options:
  * class
  * type
  * set
  * rarity

Future enhacements may include loading a deck in from a deck code supplied by the game, saving decks and retrieving your saved decks (this would require logging in).
